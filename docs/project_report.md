# E-Waste Collection & Recycling System - Project Report

## Introduction

The E-Waste Collection & Recycling System is a web application designed to help colleges and organizations manage their electronic waste collection efforts efficiently. The system allows for tracking of collected items, their quantities, locations, and status.

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Modules**:
  - `database.py`: Handles database connection and table creation
  - `models.py`: Contains all CRUD operations
  - `routes.py`: Defines all API endpoints
  - `report.py`: Generates statistics and reports

### Frontend
- **Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Structure**:
  - `templates/`: HTML files for different pages
  - `static/css/`: CSS styling files
  - Interactive JavaScript for update/delete functionality

## Database Design

The system uses SQLite3 with two main tables:

### users table
- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- name: TEXT
- email: TEXT (UNIQUE)
- password: TEXT

### ewaste_records table
- record_id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- user_id: INTEGER (foreign key to users)
- item_type: TEXT
- quantity: INTEGER
- location: TEXT
- collection_date: TEXT
- status: TEXT (default: 'Pending')

## Features Implemented

1. **Add Records**: Form to add new e-waste collection records
2. **View Records**: Table displaying all collection records with sorting
3. **Update Records**: Modal interface to update record details
4. **Delete Records**: Confirmation-based deletion of records
5. **Statistics**: Reports on collected vs pending items, item types, etc.
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
